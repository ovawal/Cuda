Project: Tour d’Algorithms: Cuda Sorting Championship

Name: Walter Okova

ID: 800866617

This project was done on jalapeno.cs.siue.edu server.
The graphs were developed on my local system.

Type 
	'make' : build all executables.
	'time' : Genrate the times for each algorithm saved on timeData.csv.
	'plots': Generate the plots 
	'clean': Delete all generated files.

Note:
'graph' only works after creating the timeData.csv.
Generate graphs on home.cs server not jalapeno - Doent work on jalapeno.
Each executable only takes two arguments- number of radom integers and seed value.
